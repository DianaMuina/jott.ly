    <p>Features of Jott.ly's Platform</p>
    <p>Writers have access to free unlimited hosting on Jott.lyâ€™s platform. Writers are able to import their work from various resources such as text editors and Microsoft Word and have access to their work on any device that supports a browser. This means as a writer, you can work on your material at anytime from almost anywhere. Removing these limitations makes producing work and collaboration a lot easier.</p>
    <p>Jott.ly provides revision history as it saves each time a change is made to your work.Split-screen views take this feature a step further and help to facilitate the collaboration between writers and copy editors.</p>
    <p>Small businesses may also be interested in purchasing a multi-seat license through Jott.ly in order to build their own team and find an editing solution for their operation at a fraction of the price it would cost to do on their own.</p>
